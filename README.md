## Ex No: 04  Implementation-of-4Bit-Up-Down-Asynchronous-Reset-Counter-Synthesis-using-Cadence-EDA-Tools
### Aim:

Synthesize 4Bit-Up-Down-Asynchronous-Reset-Counter design using Constraints and analyse reports, Timing, area and Power.

### Tool Required:

- Functional Simulation: Incisive Simulator (ncvlog, ncelab, ncsim)
- Synthesis: Genus

#### Step 1: Getting Started

- Synthesis requires three files as follows,
   + Liberty Files (.lib) &sim; + Verilog/VHDL Files (.v or .vhdl or .vhd)
   + SDC (Synopsis Design Constraint) File (.sdc)

#### Step 2 : Creating an SDC File

-	In your terminal type “gedit input_constraints.sdc” to create an SDC File if you do not have one.
-	The SDC File must contain the following commands;

        create_clock -name clk -period 2 -waveform {0 1} [get_ports "clk"]
        set_clock_transition -rise 0.1 [get_clocks "clk"]
        set_clock_transition -fall 0.1 [get_clocks "clk"]
        set_clock_uncertainty 0.01 [get_ports "clk"]
        set_input_delay -max 0.8 [get_ports "rst"] -clock [get_clocks "clk"]
        set_output_delay -max 0.8 [get_ports "count"] -clock [get_clocks "clk"]

i) Creates a Clock named “clk” with Time Period 2ns and On Time from t=0 to t=1.

ii) Sets Clock Rise and Fall time to 100ps.

iii) Sets Clock Uncertainty to 10ps.

iv) Sets the maximum limit for I/O port delay to 1ps.

#### Step 3 : Performing Synthesis

The Liberty files are present in the library path,

- The Available technology nodes are 180nm ,90nm and 45nm.
- In the terminal, initialise the tools with the following commands if a new terminal is being
used.
   + csh
   + source /cadence/install/cshrc
   + The tool used for Synthesis is “Genus”. Hence, type “genus -gui” to open the tool.
   + Genus Script file with .tcl file Extension commands are executed one by one to synthesize the netlist.

### Result: 

The generic netlist has been created, and area, power, and timing reports have been tabulated and generated using Genus.
